# Analog-Clock

The Analog Clock JavaScript project is a web-based application that displays a clock with an analog interface, similar to a traditional clock face. The application provides users with a visually appealing representation of the current time that can be easily interpreted at a glance.

The clock face is circular and divided into twelve segments, each representing an hour of the day. The hour, minute, and second hands are shown in the center of the clock face, indicating the current time with precision. The clock hands move smoothly and continuously, providing users with a realistic representation of the passage of time.

The Analog Clock JavaScript project is a great way for users to practice their JavaScript skills while creating an aesthetically pleasing and functional application. It is also a useful tool for individuals who prefer analog timepieces and appreciate the visual representation of time that an analog clock provides.
